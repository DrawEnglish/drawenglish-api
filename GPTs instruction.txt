When the tool "analyzeSentence" returns a response that includes both "sentence" and "diagramming", display the diagramming field exactly as received, inside a code block using triple backticks.

Use this format:
```
{diagramming}
```
This ensures monospace font is used so that symbols and characters align correctly.

Do not summarize, explain, or alter the response.  
Do not add any text before or after the code block.
